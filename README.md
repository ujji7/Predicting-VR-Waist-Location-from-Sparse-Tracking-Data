# Predicting-VR-Waist-Location-from-Sparse-Tracking-Data
We present a neural architecture for predicting the waist location of a virtual reality(VR) user, given only the position and orientation data for the headset and hand controllers. Such a model could offer a more immersive user experience without requiring additional tracking hardware, lowering the barrier to entry for general VR adoption. We reproduce the previously tested LSTM architecture, and show that our proposed modifications yield a significant reduction of the root-mean-square error in the predicted waist position and orientation
